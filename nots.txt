    ============================================

    * Attribute selector:
    --------------------
    Attribute selector can do an exact or a partial match
        partial matching: => syntax => [attribute-name(flag)=”attribute value”]

        flags: =>
            - ‘|’ when this flag is applied elements with attributes starting with the attribute value 
            and followed by a hyphen are matched

            - ‘^’ this flag works like ‘|’ but this is more exclusive. 
            This selects all the elements which have attribute starting with the given value

            - ‘~’ this flag selects elements which contain the attribute value in a space-separated value

            ** (i) after the attribute (irrespective) => 
            [data-name=”hello” i] will select everything with an attribute value of from ‘hello’, ‘Hello’, ‘HEllo’ to ‘HELLO’.
